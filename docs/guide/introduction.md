# _Introduction_ - The Guide to _Filmmaker_
Welcome to the guide to Filmmaker. This guide will pull you through your first animation in Filmmaker. This introduction
page serves more of a purpose to sell Filmmaker to people who are reluctant to use Filmmaker, or seem intimidated by it.
It is also here to answer frequently asked questions that you may have.

## Why Filmmaker?
Using and adding a tool such as Filmmaker to your workflow may be quite daunting, however it comes with several key advantages.

- A powerful graph editor tool for editing animations easily
- (eventually) IK support
- Ability to export as Roblox animation

## Filmmaker Alternatives
There are quite a few animation plugins out there. This includes, but not limited to:

- [Moon Animator by xSIXx][1]
- [Sun Animator by Musonius][2]
- [Roblox Animation Editor by ROBLOX][3]
- [Ro-Movie 2014 by Astreastela (broken)][4]
- Many, many more broken and malicious animation plugins out there

So why was Filmmaker even made? 

If you've probably noticed, each one of these plugins does not support the ability to "spline" animations; meaning that
Roblox is literally 20 years behind all the other game-building and animation software. The goal of Filmmaker is to
raise the bar for Roblox, and induce some competition.
