# Advanced Animation
This portion of the guide will dive into the details of how you can maximize your success whilst animating. This page will
be majorly theoretical, however there will be parts of interface and animation tutorial.

## Animating a simple punch
There are several processes that go behind animating effectively.

### Blocking
Try to create a simple animation. It does not need to look great, but what is important to have the timing for the animation
to be as worked out as possible. It's hard to pace the animation during the splining or polishing phases.

A lot of the time, animators use the "stepped" keymode during blocking phase. This keymode makes keyframes snap to the
frames value, instead of easing it in as normal. This helps a ton because a lot can be expressed simply through this
stepped motion, and it gives you a good idea what the animation will be like when you look back through it.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Try not to polish the animation much at this point. The purpose of blocking is to lay the groundwork of an animation,
    and then to fix any kinks along the way. This process will probably be the shortest part of animation.

### Splining
Tween and try to make animation look good

### (Optional) Polishing
Touch up any dry spots.
