# Contributing
There are a few rules of thumb if you want to contribute to Filmmaker.

## Comment your code!
Please, **PLEASE** comment your code. `tsdoc` style, no-nonsense comments about what you have implemented, and what it does.
It takes less than a minute, and it saves hundreds of hours of headaches when you do. So please, for the sanity of everyone
involved, comment your code.

## Clean / optimized code!
This one doesn't matter as much, but if you are purposely stalling a thread, or you are doing an unnecessary task on the
main thread, please Google _"Multithreading."_ It'll save us headaches along with all the already sweatshop hour working
animators. Please.

## Descriptive Commit Messages
This one barely matters, however it's nice for whenever you want to lean back and see who has done what. If that was ever
possible on Github, though.

## Stay hydrated!
**This is a threat.**
