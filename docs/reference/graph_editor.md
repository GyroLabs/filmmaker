# The Graph Editor
The graph editor is the single most powerful tool inside the Filmmaker animation suite. It allows the user to easily bend and contort the animations flow and timing naturally, without the burden of manually selecting easing types and directions.

## Layout
There is a toolbar at the top of the graph editor. It houses many of the controls you will be constantly using, from the
tangents to the File and Edit menus.

## Frequently Asked Questions
