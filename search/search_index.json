Animating a simple punch \u00b6 There are several processes that go behind animating effectively. Blocking \u00b6 Try to create a simple animation. It does not need to look great, but what is important to have the timing for the animation to be as worked out as possible. It's hard to pace the animation during the splining or polishing phases. A lot of the time, animators use the \"stepped\" keymode during blocking phase. This keymode makes keyframes snap to the frames value, instead of easing it in as normal. This helps a ton because a lot can be expressed simply through this stepped motion, and it gives you a good idea what the animation will be like when you look back through it. Tip Try not to polish the animation much at this point. The purpose of blocking is to lay the groundwork of an animation, and then to fix any kinks along the way. This process will probably be the shortest part of animation.

All have their own advantages and disadvantages, however. Some releases allow you to modify Filmmaker to your own needs, or use other peoples modifications on your own build of Filmmaker. Installing Filmmaker \u00b6 Roblox Plugin \u00b6 Hyperlink \u00b7 Recommended There is a Roblox release that is always up to date with the Github releases. A significant reason for using this release would be the fact that it allows you to have it automatically updated for you, instead of having to modify or rebase your local version. Github Releases \u00b6 Hyperlink \u00b7 Supported \u00b7 Modifiable There are GitHub releases dating back all the way to very early versions of Filmmaker. This allows you to use older versions of Filmmaker without having to install using other, less trustworthy methods. You can also download the source code for a given version, and modify and build from there. To install a built binary ( .rbxmx ), you must locate your plugins folder, which can be found using the Plugins Folder button under the Plugins tab in Roblox Studio. Then, drag the .rbxmx into the plugins folder. You may have to reboot your Roblox Studio client to initialize the plugin. To manually build Filmmaker, you need Rojo and roblox-ts installed. Your file structure for the source code should look something like this (it comes like this by default): . \u251c\u2500 src/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500 package.json \u251c\u2500 default.project.json \u2514\u2500 ... First, open terminal and set your working directory to the root folder. cd /path/to/Filmmaker Then, compile the TypeScript and build the model file. rbxtsc && rojo build --output Filmmaker.rbxmx If everything worked, there should be a built binary called Filmmaker.rbxmx in the root folder. Then, you could easily repeat the process detailed beforehand to install it locally. Modified Roblox Releases \u00b6 Hyperlink \u00b7 Unsupported There may be other releases on the Roblox library. However, many of these may be malicious or extremely buggy. We are not liable for any damages caused by these unsupported releases.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"guide/installation/#installation","text":"Filmmaker is quite flexible for the fact that it can be installed and used from many sources.

This guide will pull you through your first animation in Filmmaker. This introduction page serves more of a purpose to sell Filmmaker to people who are reluctant to use Filmmaker, or seem intimidated by it. It is also here to answer frequently asked questions that you may have. Why Filmmaker? \u00b6 Using and adding a tool such as Filmmaker to your workflow may be quite daunting, however it comes with several key advantages. A powerful graph editor tool for editing animations easily (eventually) IK support Ability to export as Roblox animation Filmmaker Alternatives \u00b6 There are quite a few animation plugins out there. This includes, but not limited to: Moon Animator by xSIXx Sun Animator by Musonius Roblox Animation Editor by ROBLOX Ro-Movie 2014 by Astreastela (broken) Many, many more broken and malicious animation plugins out there So why was Filmmaker even made? If you've probably noticed, each one of these plugins does not support the ability to \"spline\" animations; meaning that Roblox is literally 20 years behind all the other game-building and animation software. The goal of Filmmaker is to raise the bar for Roblox, and induce some competition. Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 How do I do X ? \u00b6 Try looking through the reference, or searching with the search bar at the top of the site. Can you fix Y ? / Can you add Z ? \u00b6 Create a new issue on the Github, or directly message one of the \"Programmer\" roles in the Discord server. Be aware that creating an issue on Github has much higher chances of actually being added, if it is a feature request. How do I directly support Filmmaker? \u00b6 You can always contribute code, or hang around in the community. However, if you cannot, you can also try favoriting or liking the plugin on the Roblox library. It helps a ton getting us more support. You can also buy the t-shirts we have on sale under our group page. Why are there no tweening styles? \u00b6 There is no tweening styles since you can just directly influence the \"tween\" using the tangents in the graph editor. In layman's terms, there does not have to be any styles anymore. Filmmaker keeps crashing repeatedly \u00b6 If there are crash logs, please take the time to send it to us, or to create an issue on Github with the crash log. It will help immensely, as it has tons of important debugging data that we need to fix the problem.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"guide/introduction/#introduction-the-guide-to-filmmaker","text":"Welcome to the guide to Filmmaker.
